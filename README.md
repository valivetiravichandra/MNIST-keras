Classify Hand written digits using Keras
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. 
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting. 
You can find the data here :http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ \n
or Import with Keras\n
There is only one problem with this model it cannot classify digits when the digit is not centered in the image but this can be solved with convolution neural network.\n
